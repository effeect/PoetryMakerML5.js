# Poetry-Maker-ML5.js 
This was a machine learning project originally intedned to be used in conjunction with twitch chat, at the time this was written which was early 2019/2020, the model had been trained however ML5.js didn't support node.js which meant the twitch intregration used some weird workaround to get it to work.

I've commited a change to tempoarily cut off twitch intregration and rework this branch into a more general website to generate poetry.

Note that this branch requires use of live server on VS Code

To-do list :
- Create a seperate branch to allow use without node.js which is technically possible at the moment.
- Update the main branch to utilise ml5.js with node.js
- Tidy up the UI interface and make it useable as of 2022/2023
